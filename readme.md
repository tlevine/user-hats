User Hats
======
At this NYU GovLab thingy, we're going to tell people to put on hats for different roles
and to think about things from different perspectives.

We want to show change-agents how to use a design process to consider different
stakeholders' interests in reacting to an observation.

We have five hats. Tom, the facilitator,  will wear something else to indicate
that he's facilitating. Up to five people will be given roles corresponding to
the hats. Other people may watch  but may not talk.

People are given these roles.

* __, a plumber
* __, a mother
* __, a high school principal
* __, an owner of a construction company
* __, ??

They are given this prompt (tentative).

> Applications to trade schools have dropped substantially over the past decade.
> 



> Put yourself in the stakeholder's shoes. The stakeholder probably won't know
> the same things that you do, so he or she will react differently than you would.

After four minutes, a new group comes in.





Ideas

* Keep it simple because it's early in the morning.
* The people like to feel like they're smart and to be told that.
* Questions
  * Lower property taxes on houses 3 br+
  * Infrastructure
